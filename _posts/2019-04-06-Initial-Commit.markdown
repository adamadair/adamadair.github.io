```
$ git commit -m "Initial Commit."
```

Commit? What does it mean to be committed? Whenever I create a new git repo the first
commit message is always `Initial Commit`. I've never thought much about the word
commit, but now that I've started this post I've got to commit to current theme of it.

Looking at the definitions listed in the Merriam-Webster dictionary there is a long list
of interesting uses for the word commit, and I think 7th one down on the list is
the most appropriate in the context of git:

> "to consign or record for preservation."

Which is boring. The one right before that, and perhaps my favorite, is:

> "to place in a prison or mental institution."

The top definition is:
>"to carry into action deliberately"

As in, let's go commit some crimes.

The next definition for commit is:
> "to obligate, or pledge oneself"

For example, I am fully committed to finishing this bottle of scotch tonight.

Hopefully I am more committed to keeping this blog updated on a regular basis that I have been with all my previous attempt at keeping a blog fizzled out. As with many of my personal projects, I enjoy *starting* projects but the follow through usually leaves much to be desired.
