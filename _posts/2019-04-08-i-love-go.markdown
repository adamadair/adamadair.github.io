Last month I ordered the UNIX sticker Pro Pack from [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/unixstickers) for $1. One of the stickers was of this cute
little guy:

![go lang gopher](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/98ed65187a84ecf897273d9fa18118ce45845057/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f676f6c616e672d73616d706c65732f676f706865722d766563746f722f6d61737465722f676f706865722e706e67){:height="10%" width="10%"}

My daughter saw the sticker and asked me about it and I had to admit I had no
idea what it was. I did a quick google search and determined it was the mascot
of the Go programming language.

I couldn't in good conscience use the sticker if I didn't know how to program
in Go, so I did the [tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1). I was impressed
with the introduction, and I came away determined to learn the language.

When learning a new language, I always try to couple the learning process with something fun. I
started learning Java by using it to create an Asteroids clone before I tried to use
it in a business application. I started learning C# by using it to program
a chess engine. I learned Python by competing on the CodeFights web site which
is now [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/). To learn Go I decided to make
an AI bot that competes on the [Riddles.io](https://www.riddles.io/) web site.
I think that goroutines may be useful that aspect, I'm just not sure how yet.

I decided the first competition to enter will be the AI Block Battle. I coded up
a starter bot that others could use to get started making a go-bot which I
put [here on github](https://github.com/adamadair/blockbattle-startbot-go). I
haven't completed my entry yet, but I'm hoping to have something to release soon.

I bought the book ["The Go Programming Language"](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=323417344445&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1020048&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=e&hvrand=1051967924508625190&hvtargid=kwd-615257639202&keywords=go+programming+books&qid=1554782982&s=gateway&sr=8-1)
by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan, and this was one of the best
computer books I have purchased in a very long time. I finished working through
it in about a week, and when I was done I had a new favorite language. This
happens to me about every 5 years, and usually I have no good use for the
language that just became my absolute favorite, and this time is no different.
This language will never become part of the technical architecture of where
I work, and I can't think of anything very useful to do with Go, other than
compete in programming competitions and develop game playing bots. Does anyone
hire Go programmers for something useful?
