I was on the phone with my sister recently when she asked me how many programming
languages I knew. It was a hard question to answer. In reality I have forgotten
far more languages than I currently know, so I think my answer went something like
I'm ready to do actual work in about 10 general purpose languages but I've worked in probably 25
languages. When I sat down and wrote down all the programming languages I've worked with
the answer was actually over 30.

I have a method for learning new programming languages that has worked well for
me over the years. The main method goes something like this:

1. Get a good book that not only teaches the important syntax elements of the language but challenges you to write code on your own. Work through the book cover to cover.
2. Use the programming language create a game or solve a fun AI problem.
3. DO NOT TRY TO LEARN TWO LANGUAGES AT ONCE!!!!!

In recent years I've added a few supplementary steps like watching YouTube videos
and entering code competitions to get up to speed quicker. These additional
tools really helped me learn Python quickly.

A few months ago I set a personal goal to learn Kotlin, and it did not go well.
Following my learning method I researched books and picked ["Kotlin Programming: The Big
Nerd Ranch Guide" by Josh Skeen and David GreenHaigh.](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/).
The book is well written and entertaining, and I would recommend it to anyone
interested in Kotlin with the following caveat: You need to know Java well to
get the most from this book. In fact, that is the problem I ran across with
all learning material for Kotlin is that it requires you to be proficient in
Java. I was certified in Java 1.2 by Sun Microsystems back in 2003, but Java is one of my
"forgotten" languages having not done any professional work in it since 2006
and writing my last line of Java in 2009.

Once I finished working through the book I was not ready for step 2 of my
method, and I quit. To be honest, at that time Kotlin looked weird to my brain. I also broke
rule three of my method in that I was in the middle of a personal AI project
in the Go language. I quickly forgot what little Kotlin I had learned.

A couple weeks ago I decided to try again. This time I tried something different,
and a paid for a course on Coursera called ["Kotlin for Java Developers"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers/home/info). I was
worried because I wasn't really a Java Developer any more, but I took a chance
and I was pleasantly surprised. The course is intended to last five weeks but
I knocked it out in 5 days. It was an enjoyable experience and I wish that had
been where I started with the language.

Now I am at step two of the method, and I need to create something for me in the
language and I am having an unusual problem: I can't think of a good way to use
this language. Kotlin seems to be a language with a purpose, and that purpose is
to replace Java in the Android ecosystem, but I have no interest in Android programming.
The other thing that makes Kotlin a challenge is that while it is technically a
general purpose programming language it is very much tied to Jet Brains IntelliJ
IDE. Kotlin support in other IDEs is minimal at best. This has required me to
learn a new development environment, and build system. I've even taken a short
course on Gradle. I feel like I've learned a lot, but now I have no where to
go with that new found knowledge.
