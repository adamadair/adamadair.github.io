US COVID-19 Deaths: 54,256

Today is day 30 of #StayHomeMN and here are some my thoughts:

- The president said some things in a press briefing on 4/23/2020 about using disinfectants and UV light in the human body to destroy the COVID-19 virus that really got a lot people upset. I watched the whole briefing and you can too [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrFqKEJwVF4). If you start at 32:00 minute mark the president sounds insane. If you watch the whole briefing and take his remarks in context he sounds much less insane. 

- My wife and three of my children are considered essential workers and they take on the risk of leaving the house almost every day to go to work to perform their essential duties. I am not considered an essential worker, and yet I make a great deal more than all of them in terms of pay. I think this situation highlights the unfairness inherent in our capitalist system. The fact that essential workers have not colectively realized this and started a revolt is great for the rest of us. It is selfish, but I hope it lasts.

- The next season of Fortnite has been postponed until June 4th. This really bums me out. I completed all of season 2 chapter 2 challenges, and I was looking forward to a new bunch of challenges to give me that false sense of accomplishment.
