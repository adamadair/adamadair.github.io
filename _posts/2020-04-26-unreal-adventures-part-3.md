summary: Kicking the tires of Unreal Engine 4 on Linux
---

I woke up ready to get after Unreal Engine 4 this morning and when I entered my office there it was,
ready and waiting for me! I was so happy, even though it was only a small measure of success. I 
completed creating a simple blueprint project as prescribed in the install document, ran it, and 
rejoiced! Everything was working. So I shut down the engine.

Then I started it up.

And...it...took...forever...to...start...back...up....

So I shut it down and started it up. Again, it takes about 5 minutes to start up. This is not ideal 
performance, but I decided I can worry about perfomance later, I'm ready to get into the 
course material. I spent a couple hours working through some of the course and I got a good feel 
for how the rest of the course is going to go if I stick with Linux.

The bottom line is this: I don't think this is going to work for me. 

Here are my reasons why I won't sick with it:

1. The perfomance on my system is terrible. This is not opinion, this is a fact. I should have done some searching
   around the internet to find out what other peoples experiences with running the engine on Linux
   have been, becaue it is universally agreed that UE4 performance on Linux is garbage. The performance
   problem is more than just annoying it actually hinders work a great deal. I've used the Unity and Godot
   game engines on Linux and never experienced anything as poor as this. When you work with Linux
   you get used to quirkiness and certain issues with SDL, but this is different. This feels
   like there is something wrong with my system and I just don't have the will to try and figure 
   it out.

2. The integration with CLion (my C++ editor of choice) is bad. It simply doesn't work. I did get 
   it to work with Visual Studio code so that intellisense worked as expected and I could launch
   the editor from the engine, but I'm not a fan of VS Code. I pay good money to use CLion, so that was
   more than mildly disappointing.

3. I worry about wasting time. If the perfomance of the editor is this bad, how bad will a game running on
   the engine work in Linux. If I am going to make a game, it is going to have to run on Linux. There is 
   a wikipedia page that lists all the professional games written using UE4, and only a few run on Linux.
   I have no real desire to become a professional game developer, but I am not going to ignore a huge
   red flag either. There is a reason they aren't targetting Linux. 
   
I believe that my Unreal Engine 4 adventure has come to an end. This is not the tool for me. As with
any good adventure lessons have been learned and knowlege aquired.
