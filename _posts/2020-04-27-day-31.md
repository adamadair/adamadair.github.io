US COVID-19 Deaths: 56,797

These are some of my thoughts on the 31st day of #StayHomeMN:

- Hillary Clinton endorsed Joe Biden's candidacy for President. I'm sure he really appreciates that. It seems like just yesterday she was losing to Donald Trump.

- There is a 1.2 mile wide asteroid that is going to fly close the earth, well...[within 4 million miles anyway](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/28/world/asteroid-earth-flyby-1998-or2-scn-trnd/index.html). It would have made the perfect 2020 if it could have plowed right into Earth. It seems like a missed opportunity.

- Politics dominates the news right now, perhaps mainly due to our unconventional president. It does feel like politics, sports, and religion all matter much less in times like this though. I've lost my give-a-shit for those three topics.
