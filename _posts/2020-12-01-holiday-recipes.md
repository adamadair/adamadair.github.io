Today I came across a collection of recipes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Beathhigh/status/1333802426885804034) of all places. I hate twitter, and I don't want to lose these so I will write them down here and attribute them to their original authors the best I can.

## Inspector Rebus’s patented recipe for Scotch Eggs (Ian Rankin):
```
Put eggs on to boil.
Pour a Scotch while you wait.
Keep drinking.
Throw away the eggs.
```

## Martin Burgers (Dean Martin)
```
1 lb. ground beef
2 oz. bourbon--chilled

Preheat a heavy frying pan and sprinkle 
bottom lightly with table salt. Mix meat,
handling lightly, just enough to form into
four patties. Grill over medium-high 
heat about 4 minutes on each side.

Pour chilled bourbon in chilled shot glass
and serve meat and bourbon on a TV tray.
```

## Sinatra Burgers (Frank Sinatra)
```
1.  Call for Deano.

2.  Tell him to make you a fuckin burger.

3.  Drink his bourbon.
```

## Noël Coward's perfect dry martini
```
Take an iced glass
Fill with gin
Wave in the general direction of Italy
Enjoy
```
