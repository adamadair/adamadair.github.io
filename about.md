My name is Adam Adair. I am a programmer, gamer, and home brewer. I created this blog to share stuff about those interests. I post mainly about technology and programming, but I may also post about brewing and gaming topics as well.

## Background
- M.S. in Software Engineering, University of St. Thomas, Saint Paul, MN, 2009
- B.S. in Computer Science, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, 1996

I've been working in IT for over 20 years as a programmer. I currently work for a large well known medical organization in Rochester, MN where
I've worked on laboratory, radiology, and emergency medicine systems.
